# Car Rental: Predictive Pricing Model

This repository contains the project materials for **Team Beijing's predictive modeling initiative**, conducted as part of MMA 867 at Queen's University. The project aims to optimize car pricing strategies through a robust predictive model built with multivariate and Lasso regression.

## Project Overview

This project leverages predictive analytics to deliver actionable insights for pricing decisions in the automotive industry, with a focus on premium car pricing. By analyzing 26 key variables and employing advanced regression techniques, the model identifies significant predictors of car prices and provides a framework for informed decision-making.

## Key Highlights

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Addressed data inconsistencies and improved data quality.
- Introduced a new feature, **Brand Reputation**, to enhance predictions.
- Standardized numerical features and encoded categorical variables.

### Model Development
- Utilized **Lasso regression** for feature selection and complexity reduction.
- Optimized model parameters using **GridSearchCV**.
- Evaluated model performance with **RMSE**, **R²**, and **MAPE** metrics.

### Performance
- **Testing R²**: 0.9404
- **MAPE**: 10.76%  

## Insights and Applications
- Identified key drivers behind car pricing.
- Provided tools for manufacturers, dealers, and rental companies to improve pricing strategies.

## Next Steps
1. **Model Refinement**: Enhance accuracy and fine-tune feature selection.
2. **Car Pricing Calculator**: Build an intuitive tool for instant price estimates based on user inputs.
3. **Scenario Analysis**: Test the model under varying market conditions for reliability and adaptability.

## Files Included
- **Notebook**: Full implementation of the predictive modeling process.
- **Presentation**: Summary of the methodology, findings, and recommendations.
- **Recording**: Walkthrough of the project presentation.
